A LudumDare 34 Compo Entry by James Mowery

This game was submitted on December 13, 2015, to the Ludum Dare 34 Compo contest.
It's a very simple, unfinished game that I only less than 10 hours working on,
most of which was spent learning about game development and such.

It's nothing amazing to look at, but I might revisit the idea in the future.

## Controls

**Movement**

* Left / Right keyboard buttons
* Mouse Click Left or Right side of screen
* Touch Left or Right side of screen

## Objective

Navigate through the platforms while also collecting the sun. Collecting the sun maintains
the current speed of the game. Missing the sun tokens means the game speeds up.
